I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing/I don't know why
Doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that mind/I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
[I tried so hard]
In spite of the way you were mocking me
